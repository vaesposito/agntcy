"""Wire contract shared by `ttt-backend` and `ttt-agent`.

Both halves of the system import from here; nothing in this module touches
sqlite, the agent SDK, or any MCP server. Keeping it dependency-free means
the agent image (which excludes the heavy backend deps) can still validate
incoming/outgoing payloads against the same schemas the backend produces.

Three groups of schemas:

1. **Agent inbound** — what the backend POSTs to the agent on `/chat` /
   `/ingest`, including the project snapshot the agent needs to build its
   system prompt.

2. **Agent → backend callbacks** — bodies the agent's persist hook and log
   appender POST back to `ttt-backend/internal/...`.

3. **SSE event types** — the wire format streamed from agent to backend
   (and proxied to the browser).
